# Adrian Abelarde's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I am Adrian Abelarde, a passionate full-stack developer with a strong foundation in Computer Science. This website showcases my skills, projects, and experiences in the world of web development.

## About Me

My journey as a web developer began when I started my Computer Science degree at [Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila](https://plm.edu.ph/) in 2020. Since then, I have been continuously honing my skills and working on various projects to expand my knowledge and expertise.

I have a deep love for exploring the latest web technologies and leveraging my diverse skill set to build innovative and user-friendly applications. Whether it's designing intuitive user interfaces in Figma, implementing real-time features, or optimizing performance, I always strive to blend creativity with technical excellence.

## Projects

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects:

-   [RenewMe](https://myrenewme.com/): A web application that helps users renew their subscriptions and manage their accounts.
-   [Constflow](https://constflow.vercel.app/): A real-time construction management platform for streamlining project workflows.
-   [SyntechX Labs](https://www.syntechx.io/): A cutting-edge technology company specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

I have also completed an internship at [Focus Global Inc.](https://www.focusglobalinc.com/), where I gained valuable experience in a professional setting.

## Leadership and Collaboration

As the Web Development Lead at [Google Developers Students Club (PLM)](https://www.gdsc-plm.org/), I have had the privilege of collaborating on impactful projects and leading a team to victory in the Diliman Solutions Challenge 2023. This experience has strengthened my leadership skills and ability to work effectively in a team environment.

## Interests and Hobbies

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest design trends, gaming, reading self-help books, cycling, or embarking on exciting adventures with my loved ones. I believe in maintaining a healthy work-life balance and constantly seeking opportunities for personal growth.
